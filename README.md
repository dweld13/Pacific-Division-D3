# Pacific-Division-D3
Line graph using d3.js to show wins by year for teams in the Pacific Division of the NBA.

Overview:
Personal project getting familiar with d3.js and building a webpage. The intent is to build a line graph showing each team's wins by year for the Pacific Division of the NBA. May be able to add interactivity in the future. While, at this time, the page is only viewable using a local server.
